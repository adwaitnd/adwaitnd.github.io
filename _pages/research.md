I am currently interested in the following areas of research:

- [Time Synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization): How do we get many entities to agree on what the time is and have them work together?
- [Embedded Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system): How can we design and use tiny computers that can be a part of us and our environment?
- [Wireless Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless): How can we communicate useful information using radio transmissions, in the most efficient form, and using the simplest mechanisms?
