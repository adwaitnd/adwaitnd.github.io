I am currently interested in the following areas of research:

- [Time Synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization): How do we get many entities to agree on what the time is and have them work together?
- [Embedded Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system): How can we design and use tiny computers that can be a part of us and our environment?
- [Wireless Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless): How can we communicate useful information using radio transmissions, in the most efficient form, and using the simplest mechanisms?

## Publications

### Conferences

- **Pulsar: A Wireless Propagation-Aware Clock Synchronization Platform** [[slides](/assets/docs/pulsar-slides-rtas17.pdf)] [[pdf](/assets/docs/pulsar-rtas17.pdf)]  
    Adwait Dongare, Patrick Lazik, Niranjini Rajagopal and Anthony Rowe  
    *In Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS)*  

    We design and evaluate a wireless clock synchronization system called Pulsar that achieves better than 5 nanosecond accuracy using a combination of an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio and a chip-scale atomic clock (CSAC). We expect it to have direct applications in next-generation wireless systems that target high scalability.

- **Timeline: An Operating System Abstraction for Time-Aware Applications** [[pdf](/assets/docs/timeline-rtss16.pdf)] [[link](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7809855/)]  
    Fatima Anwar, Sandeep Dâ€™souza, Andrew Symington, Adwait Dongare, Ragunathan Rajkumar, Anthony Rowe, and Mani Srivastava.  
    *In Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS), 2016 IEEE*, pp. 191-202. IEEE, 2016  

    We introduce the Timeline abstraction to Linux to simplify device synchronization and development of real-time applications.

### Workshops

- **OpenChirp: A Low-Power Wide-Area Networking Architecture** [[slides](/assets/docs/openchirp-slides-smartedge17.pdf)] [[pdf](/assets/docs/openchirp-smartedge17.pdf)]  
    Adwait Dongare, Craig Hesling, Khushboo Bhatia, Artur Balanuta, Ricardo Lopes Pereira, Bob Iannucci and Anthony Rowe  
    *In First International Workshop on Smart Edge Computing and Networking (SmartEdge), 2017 IEEE*  

    We describe the architecture of a Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) named OpenChirp and the early experience in deploying it around CMU and Pittsburgh.
