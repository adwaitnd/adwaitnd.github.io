I am currently interested in the following areas of research:

- [TinyML](https://edge.seas.harvard.edu/tinyml): How to build small and efficient machine learning models for very specialized tasks
- [Foundation models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_model) for the physical world: How to build complex artificial intelligence models that can operate on varied data from the real world
- [Wireless Sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing): How can we identify and track changes in our physical environment by observing it from afar?
- [Embedded Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system): How can we design and use tiny computers that can be a part of us and our environment?
## Publications

### Thesis

The thesis for my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at CMU can be found [here](/assets/docs/Dongare-thesis.pdf). I looked at improving the coverage and capabilities of a wireless sensor networks by receiving signals from the same sensor using a distributed system of receivers. We had to use techniques for coherent combining, time synchronization and embedded computing built of top of a low-power wide-area network that we deployed around the city of Pittsburgh and elsewhere.

### Conferences

    **Charm: Exploiting Geographical Diversity Through Coherent Combining in Low-Power Wide-Area Networks**

    Adwait Dongare, Revathy Narayanan, Akshay Gadre, Anh Luong, Artur Balanuta, Swarun Kumar, Bob Iannucci, and Anthony Rowe.  
    *In the International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN), 2018 at Porto, Portugal*  

    We design a system for LoRa low-power wide-area networks, that combines weak radio transmissions at multiple gateway receivers and coherently combines the signals to decode the underlying data. This system improves the coverage of the network and allows wireless devices to communicate at higher data rates, which results in more battery life.

    **Pulsar: A Wireless Propagation-Aware Clock Synchronization Platform**  
    [[slides](/assets/docs/pulsar-slides-rtas17.pdf)]  [[pdf](/assets/docs/pulsar-rtas17.pdf)]  
    Adwait Dongare, Patrick Lazik, Niranjini Rajagopal and Anthony Rowe  
    *In Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS),  2017 at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA*    

    We design and evaluate a wireless clock synchronization system called Pulsar that achieves better than 5 nanosecond accuracy using a combination of an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio and a chip-scale atomic clock (CSAC). We expect it to have direct applications in next-generation wireless systems that target high scalability.
