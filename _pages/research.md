I am currently interested in the following areas of research:

- [Time Synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization): How do we get many entities to agree on what the time is and have them work together? I look at what can we do with cutting-edge devices that keep very precise time. Further, I also study what we can do with very inexpensive devices that keep inaccurate time.
- [Embedded Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system): How can we design and use tiny computers that can be a part of us and our environment?
- [Wireless Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless): How can we communicate useful information using radio transmissions, in the most efficient form, and using the simplest mechanisms?

## Publications

### Conferences

- <a name="pulsar-rtas2017"></a>
    **Pulsar: A Wireless Propagation-Aware Clock Synchronization Platform**  
    [[slides](/assets/docs/pulsar-slides-rtas17.pdf)]  [[pdf](/assets/docs/pulsar-rtas17.pdf)]  
    Adwait Dongare, Patrick Lazik, Niranjini Rajagopal and Anthony Rowe  
    *In Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS),  2017 at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA*    

    We design and evaluate a wireless clock synchronization system called Pulsar that achieves better than 5 nanosecond accuracy using a combination of an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio and a chip-scale atomic clock (CSAC). We expect it to have direct applications in next-generation wireless systems that target high scalability.
