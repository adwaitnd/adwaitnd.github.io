## Professional Summary

Technical leader with 5+ years shipping end-to-end systems deployed on 1.5B+ devices including ML pipelines, wireless protocols, and sensor fusion architectures. Architect solutions spanning training infrastructure design, model architecture decisions, synthesis-based data generation, and on-device deployment under strict power/latency/privacy constraints. Lead cross-functional engineering teams (5-10 engineers) through problem formulation, strategic system design, and production deployment. PhD in ECE from CMU with expertise in distributed optimization and multi-sensor fusion. 3 granted US patents, best paper awards (IPSN, RTAS), DARPA SubT finalist (4th overall).

## Research Interests

Building foundation models and scalable training infrastructure for physical domains beyond language—3D perception and manipulation, contact-rich tasks, deformable objects, and multi-modal sensor fusion. Focus on designing simulation-based training systems that generate diverse, physically-realistic scenarios at scale. Bridging sim-to-real gap for physical interactions (contact dynamics, material properties) while leveraging production experience shipping ML under strict compute/power/privacy constraints to inform foundation model architecture and training infrastructure design.
