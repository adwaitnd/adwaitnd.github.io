Hello there!

I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://ece.cmu.edu) since August 2014. I work with [WiSELab](http://wise.ece.cmu.edu/) and am advised by Prof. Anthony Rowe.

I am currently interested in research on sensing with wireless signals, sensor networking, embedded systems and time synchronization. You can find more information about these topics, about my work and my publications in the [research](/research/) section. I'm also involved with the development of [OpenChirp](https://openchirp.io/), a free software stack for managing and using a large number of sensing devices.

In the summer of 2017, I was interning with [Kilby Labs](http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/innovation/research-development/Kilby-Labs.html) at Texas Instruments in Dallas, Texas exploring the uses of a crystal-less Bluetooth radio chip. Crystal-less radios are an interesting topic because modern radios must be driven by accurate clocks, which are often provided from the oscillations of a quartz crystal.

In the summer of 2015, I spent some time at Apple programming firmware for phones and wearables. Firmware is simple low-level software that works very closely with hardware.

Before CMU, I finished my B.Tech. in Engineering Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 2014. Back then I was building detectors for physics experiments. I spent a lot of my spare time on electronics projects; including developing the electronic systems of an electric race car for the [IIT-Bombay Racing Team](http://www.iitbracing.org/). They do some fantastic work, so go cheer for them!

I spent a summer interning at Forschüngzentrum Jülich, Jülich, Germany in 2013 working on the PANDA experiment and another one at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, Hannover, Germany in 2012 working on the GEO-600 detector.
