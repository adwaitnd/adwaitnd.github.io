Hello there!

I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://ece.cmu.edu) since August 2014. I work with [WiSELab](http://wise.ece.cmu.edu/) and am advised by Prof. Anthony Rowe.

I am currently interested in research on Time Synchronization, Embedded Systems and Wireless Networks. You can find more information about these topics and about my work in the [research](/research/) section.

In the summer of 2015, I spent some time at Apple programming firmware for phones and wearables. Firmware is simple low-level software that works very closely with hardware.

Before CMU, I finished my B.Tech. in Engineering Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 2014. Back then I was building various detectors for physics experiments. I spent a lot of my spare time on electronics projects; including developing the electronic systems of an electric race car for the [IIT-Bombay Racing Team](http://www.iitbracing.org/). They do some fantastic work, so go cheer for them!

I spent a summer interning at Forschüngzentrum Jülich, Jülich, Germany working on the PANDA experiment and another one at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, Hannover, Germany working on the GEO-600 detector.
