Hello there!

I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University since August 2014. I work with [WiSELab](http://wise.ece.cmu.edu/) and am advised by Prof. Anthony Rowe.

I am currently interested in research on Time Synchronization, Embedded Systems and Wireless Network. You can find more information about these topics and about my work in the [research](/research/) section.

In the summer of 2015, I spent some time at Apple programming firmware for phones and wearables. Firmware is simple low-level software that works very closely with hardware.

Before CMU, I finished my B.Tech. in Engineering Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 2014. Back then I was building various detectors for physics experiments. I spent a lot of my spare time building electronics projects; including developing the electronic systems of an electric race car for the [IIT-Bombay Racing Team](http://www.iitbracing.org/). They do some fantastic work, so go cheer for them!
