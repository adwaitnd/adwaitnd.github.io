Hello there!

I build systems that observe the world using all kinds of signals and then act meaningfully on what they observe. I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Carnegie Mellon University](http://ece.cmu.edu) in 2020, where I worked on wireless sensing and networking at [WiSELab](http://wise.ece.cmu.edu/).

Currently, I am a Senior Software Developer at Apple, where I lead technical efforts on technologies to observe proximity such as vision, wireless sensors and motion sensors. My work spans ML systems, ultra-wideband (UWB) technologies, and vision-based sensing algorithms. I've led teams developing secure vision algorithms for next-generation Apple devices and led the software bring-up for Apple’s 2nd generation UWB chip.

My work had led to 3 granted US patents, systems and code shipping on ~1.5 billion devices, and academic recognition like best paper awards at IPSN 2018 and RTAS 2017. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and production systems, with expertise in wireless sensing, computer vision, and embedded systems. You can find more about my work and publications in the [research](/research/) section.

My PhD research focused on distributed reception architectures for low-power wide-area networks, including the development of [OpenChirp](https://openchirp.io/), an open-source platform for managing IoT devices. Our work on LoRa networks and wireless synchronization earned a best paper award and was recognized for advancing coherent combining techniques in wireless systems.

During my PhD, I also worked on the DARPA Subterranean Challenge as part of the CMU-Oregon State explorer team, which placed 4th overall, won the tunnel circuit stage and was the runner-up in the urban stage.

Before graduate school, I completed my B.Tech. in Engineering Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 2014, where I built detectors for physics experiments and developed electronic systems for the [IIT-Bombay Racing Team's](http://www.iitbracing.org/) electric race car. I also spent one summer at Forschüngzentrum Jülich working on the PANDA experiment and another summer at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics working on the GEO-600 gravitational wave detector.
