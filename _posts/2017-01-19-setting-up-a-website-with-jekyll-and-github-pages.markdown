title: Setting up a website with Jekyll and Github Pages
layout: single

This post has some of my personal notes that helped me setup this website, in case I ever need to do this again (I probably will).

There are a number of steps involved, broadly:

1. Clone a Jekyll theme you like on Github. I used the [Minimal mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme on Github.
2. Make the relevant configuration changes
3. Setup site layout and navigation
4. Setup aliasing so that the Github pages site is visible on a custom domain, in my case [adwait.dongare.com](http://adwait.dongare.com)
