Points to talk about:

- Some things are very hard unless you already belong to a "club" e.g. credit cards, insurance, dating, jobs
- Once people join the "club" they tend to forget about the original problems in the system they had to undergo while joining the "club"
- Looks similar to the bootstrap problem
- How did technology solve the bootstrap problem?
- What other areas have bootstrap problems that I'm not yet aware of?
