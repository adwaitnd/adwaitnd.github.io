I decided to drive to California for my internship this summer because I wanted to have a car while in the Bay Area. I also decided to drive it back because I like long drives. While the trip to California was fairly quick and uneventful, I planned out the return trip to be a bit more fun.

After much contemplation about how to write this down, I'm going to try my best using just text and a photo album with descriptions. I'll rant about how limiting Google Photos is later on; just thinking about it makes me angry >:(

A drive from The San Fransisco Bay area to Pittsburgh is at least 40 hours along. I planned my way through the southern route, which goes south to Las Vegas and Arizona, then up to Utah and Colorado and finally west through Kansas, Indiana and Ohio. Why such a weird route? Because there are quite a few National Parks along this way. 

## Day 1: Drive through Death Valley

### "Save water" vs "water grows food" signs around I-5

One of the mot interesting things I saw on I-5 were the "save water" vs "dam water grows food" signs all along the highway.

What do I think about it? Southern California is basically a desert which feeds off irrigation. I think it's fine to support some agriculture there but there's no justification to grow water hungry crops like cotton and almonds.

### Driving in Death Valley

Death Valley is a proper desert.
It is very very hot, very very dry and has lots of twisty climbs and steep descends.
My car AC was not even close to be being prepared for this.
Thankfully, someone suggested carrying a water squirt bottle!

### Stargazing in Death Valley

I'd heard that Death Valley has one of the best night skies so I stopped by the road after sunset to experience it.
A coyote showed up at the spot (probably having the same idea) and scared me away.
A saw another coyote pup on the drive to the motel. They look like tiny dog puppies.

Fun fact: I passed by Area 51 on the way to my motel
